                <p>In response to <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/">'Turing Complete User'</a> by Olia Lialina</p>

                <p style="font-weight:bold">1) What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</p>
                <p>Lialina's opinion of the word user is one of necessity. In turn, she rejects the recent attempts to erase the the distinction between user and people by technology and UX designers. Her reasoning for this is multiple, though it can boiled down to a lack of transparency in many different aspects. Redefining users as simply people eliminates the context of the system in which people are users of. By forgetting we are all users using system, developers are able to deny us the ability to even protect our digital rights as computer users. An example given by Lialina are computer products produced with a specified task in mind (such as game systems, smart speakers, and even wireless routers) being essentially overly streamlined, computers constrained to a single task. In reality, a simple wireless router can calculate equations thousands of times faster than any human. However, because of its programmed hardware and software restraints, the user will never be able to use it as anything but a simple wireless router. This creates the problem in which a user has no control over what said router can do outside of the overly streamlined possibilities given. If one should one run into a problem without an obvious solution given by the system, would we simply be shit out of luck because we can't dig further into the system? Lialina argues that this shouldn't be the case. The rights of users, as argued by Lialina, include the ability to resolve one's own issues within their own means while simultaneously creating demand for a better product. Furthermore, and more fundamentally, the user has the right to know they are a user using a system.</p>

                <p style="font-weight:bold">2) What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</p>
                <p>2) The 'general purpose user' which Lialina describes is one who is able to achieve their goal despite not having the pre-programmed tools to achieve it. This ideal user is able to re-purpose the tools (applications, devices, etc) they have to solve any particular goal at hand. To quote:</p>
                <p>“They can [...] find a way to publish photos online without flickr, tweet without twitter, like without facebook, make a black frame around pictures without instagram, remove a black frame from an instagram picture and even wake up at 7:00 without a 'wake up at 7:00' app."</p>
                <p>In essence, the 'general purpose user' is one which can solve think outside of a given program/application/device/tool.</p>

                <p style="font-weight:bold">3)From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</p>
                <p>I have a hobby of playing around with Linux distributions. There are many distros (for short) available openly online which take a much more manual approach to installation. For reference, one can simply install Windows 10 by plugging in the install media and simply pressing next or skip over and over again. Linux distributions such as Gentoo or Arch Linux, however, require the user to manually perform several tasks in command line before being able to run. Such things include partitioning your hard disk, extracting the required packages, compiling your own kernel, etc. Even then, some of these distributions will not come with a user interface post-installation either. Should one want to work in an interface that isn't command line, they would have to manually install that too.</p>
