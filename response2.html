                <p>In response to <a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools">'The Poetry of Tools'</a> by Mindy Seu</p>

                <p style="font-weight:bold;">1) In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</p>
                <p>As mentioned in the paragraph directly after, Seu takes notice of in the lack of meaningful interaction between technology and the humans who experience it. Outside of the sheer novel experiences which it brings us, people have become so accustomed to technology to the point where the syntax of computer usage has become synonymous with human living. Swiping, skimming, typing, clicking, opening, closing, trashing, cutting, pasting; all of these things have become things we can natural do. It’s almost like walking at this point.</p>
                <p>I believe Seu is asking us to de-contextualize ourselves from the technological world. Rather than do what we natural do with a computer, Seu asks us to contemplate what the computer is really doing for us. What is the purpose behind each interaction we have we our digital tools? What are the limitations of these tools? What potentials can be reach by using digital tools? These are all things we just seem to forget when doing anything on the computer. Much like how we contemplate every word when we write poetry, prose, or really anything academic/artistic, we as digital artists/designers should contemplate every action we take on the computer. Realizing the limitations of technology, much like realizing the limitation of language, “helps us recognize [it’s] poetic potential”.</p><br />

                <p style="font-weight:bold;">2) Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</p>
                <p> Seu describes Regeneration as “[giving] new life to old works by preserving it and making it accessible”. Essentially, Seu is pointing out three amazing things technology allows us to do: fix things, make them public, and build on top of others ideas. Weather it be digitally recreating a flip book, or creating your text generation bot based on A House of Dust, technology allows art to continuously grow. As more work is made and re-made and made public, artists/designers are able to re-interpret said works in whatever way they see fit. Weather it is to re-create the original for preservation purpose or create something brand new, the life of a piece of work will still live on in its iterations.</p>
